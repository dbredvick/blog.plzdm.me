Whether you're looking for a tool to up your Twitter game or an example of how to build a SaaS, I'm excited to announce Plz DM Me is entirely free and open source.

<!--more-->

## Why the change?

I haven't had as much time to ship additional features to Plz DM Me as I originally wanted to. Rather than the project slowly fading away and the code rotting, I figured it might be better to open source it.

Because of the fixed costs with hosting (Vercel) and low database usage (Supabase), I can comfortably make this project free to use.

I also love the idea of sharing code with other builders trying to create their first SaaS app.

## Where's the code

You can see all the code over on my GitHub. The repo is [`better-twitter-dms`](https://github.com/dbredvick/better-twitter-dms).
